    <h4>follow links to github for code</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><h3><a href = 'https://github.com/crazybilly/muadc'>muadc</a></h3><p>a collection of everyday tools I use day in and day out to optimize my workflow</li>
        <li><h3><a href = "https://github.com/crazybilly/mumodels">mumodels</a></h3><p>functions to build training data for predictive models from our datawarehouse</li>
        <li><h3><a href = 'https://github.com/crazybilly/rmapcounties'>rmapcounties</a></h3><p>a package designed to pull a list of counties within driving distance of a location, particularly useful when a development officer is hosting an event out of town and we want to build an invite list.</li>
        <li><h3><a href= 'https://github.com/crazybilly/muaddresses'>muaddresses</a></h3><p>a package to standardize and validate mailing addresses. We use Runner to validate addresses as they're entered in the database--this package allows me to validate addresses against the USPS service so I can compare addresses received from outside sources against our already-standardized addresses.</li>
        <li><h3><a href= 'https://github.com/crazybilly/fundRaising'>fundRaising</a></h3><p>a work-in-progress package, written in collaboration with analysts from other institutions, with a goal of providing useful tools to fundraising analysts at any institution.
