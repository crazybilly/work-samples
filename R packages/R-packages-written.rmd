R Packages by Jake Tolbert
===========================


[muadc](https://github.com/crazybilly/muadc)
------------------------------------
a collection of everyday tools I use day in and day out to optimize my workflow

[mumodels](https://github.com/crazybilly/mumodels)
------------------------------------
functions to build training data for predictive models from our datawarehouse

[rmapcounties](https://github.com/crazybilly/rmapcounties)
------------------------------------
a package designed to pull a list of counties within driving distance of a location, particularly useful when a development officer is hosting an event out of town and we want to build an invite list.

[muaddresses](https://github.com/crazybilly/muaddresses)
------------------------------------
a package to standardize and validate mailing addresses. We use Runner to validate addresses as they're entered in the database--this package allows me to validate addresses against the USPS service so I can compare addresses received from outside sources against our already-standardized addresses.


[fundRaising](https://github.com/crazybilly/fundRaising)
------------------------------------
a work-in-progress package, written in collaboration with analysts from other institutions, with a goal of providing useful tools to fundraising analysts at any institution.
